    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces uncooked rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cups cubed, peeled butternut squash from 1 small squash</li>
        <li>6 fresh sage leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Gouda cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add pasta and cook according to package directions for al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta cooking water; set pasta aside.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium. Add butternut squash, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in milk, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, nutmeg, and turmeric and bring to a boil over high, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer squash mixture into a blender and add Dijon mustard. Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening. Process until very smooth, about 30 seconds. (Alternatively, puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth, about 3 minutes).</li>
        <li> Add pasta and pureed squash mixture to Dutch oven; gently heat over medium until pasta is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Stir in Cheddar, Gouda and Parmesan and cook over low, stirring constantly, until smooth, about 1 minute. Stir in 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water. Cook, stirring often, and add remaining cooking water, 1/4 cup at a time, as needed, until sauce is creamy and clings to pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with additional salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide among bowls and garnish with thyme, black pepper, and Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
